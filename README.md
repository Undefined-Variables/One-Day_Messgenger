One-Day Messenger

One day, I woke up and thought today I'm going to climb that hill called Javascript!

The goal is to create an instant messenger for web using service worker. Then add an android app written in android studio 
plus a ios app written with xcode on MAC IOS X and share data with them all and working together! How??? With FireBase...

I'm using React which is a javascript framework and Firebase which is Google’s mobile platform for quickly developing apps. Firebase provides a suite of tools for authenticating applications, building reactive client apps, reporting analytics, as well as a host of other helpful resources for managing apps in general. It also provides back-end management for web, iOS, Android, and Unity, a 3D development platform.

Reason for using FireBase aside from the fact it is clearly awesome is we can later add andriod and ios applications.

FireBase free tariffs limits are 100 concurrent connections to cloud databse and 1GB per month. 

We’re going to build an application called "One-Day Messenger". It will allow authenticated users to send and read messages and users can sign up by providing their email and creating a password, or by authenticating via Google or GitHub using oAuth.

Google account is required to use Firebase.
