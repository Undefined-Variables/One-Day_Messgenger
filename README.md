#### One-Day Messenger

Web - Android - Apple

**Goal**<br>
We’re going to build an application called "One-Day Messenger". It will allow authenticated users to send and
read messages and users can sign up by providing their email and creating a password, or by authenticating 
via Google or GitHub using oAuth. Reason for using FireBase aside from the fact it's awesome is we can 
use it cross platform (Web, Andriod and Apple ios).

management for web, iOS, Android, and Unity, a 3D development platform.
